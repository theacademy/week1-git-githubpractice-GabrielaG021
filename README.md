# GITHUB PRACTICE CLASSROOM

This repository is going to be a "container" to store all project files for ungraded work (including code-alongs, in-class activities, and other exercises) in this repository and push changes as you work through those activities.

## Steps to Update Repo:
  1.  Go to the repo in your local machine (main page, not a specific folder)
  2.  Right click in empty space, and open Git Bash
  3.  In git bash follow these steps:
      a.  git status (check if changes appear in the system)
      b.	git add –all.
      c.	git commit -m “[Message of the changes made]”
      d.	git push
      e.	git status (make sure there is no commits waiting)
  4.	Update the repo in the GitHub browser.
  5.	Check if the new updates have appeared.
